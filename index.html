    <h2>Week 1 : Short Bio</h2>
    <p> An area in my life that I feel represents me the most is likely going to be the gym. Every since I was 13 years old, I have always had the <br> motivation of becoming the best 
        version of myself. Going to the gym consistently for over a decade now has really tought me how to be disciplined in what I do. <br> For example; if I have a goal in mind, 
        (either be losing weight or gaining weight) I will do all I can to achieve that goal.
        I will stay disciplined until that goal is achieved or close to it. <br>With that being said, being self disciplined allows one to subconsciously improve 
        their overall well being in life, either through means of happiness or motivation to get something done. <br> Going to the gym can also help those to become less anxious, more confident
        and boost one's self-esteem which in return helps these individuals to use these practices in their everyday lives to get ahead of their peers.<br> Consequently, these practices not only propelled my confidence 
        but my ability to achieve whatever I want to achieve in life, which in return has helped me to become who I am today.</p>
