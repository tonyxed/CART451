    <h2>Week 1 : Short Bio</h2>
    <p> An area in my life that I feel represents me the most is likely going to be the gym. Every since I was 13 years old, I have always had the <br> motivation of becoming the best 
        version of myself. Going to the gym consistently for over a decade now has really tought me how to be disciplined in what I do. <br> For example; if I have a goal in mind, I will do all I can to achieve that goal.
        I will stay disciplined until that goal is achieved or close to it. With that being said, being self disciplined <br> allows one to subconsciously improve their overall well being in 
        life, either through happiness or motivation to get something done. </p>
