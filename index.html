   <h1> Weekly Responses </h1> 
    <h2>Week 1 : Short Bio</h2>
    <p> An area in my life that I feel represents me the most is likely going to be the gym. Every since I was 13 years old, I have always had the <br> motivation of becoming the best 
        version of myself. Going to the gym consistently for over a decade now has really tought me how to be disciplined in what I do. <br> For example; if I have a goal in mind, 
        (either be losing weight or gaining weight) I will do all I can to achieve that goal.
        I will stay disciplined until that goal is achieved or close to it. <br>With that being said, being self disciplined allows one to subconsciously improve 
        their overall well being in life, either through means of happiness or motivation to get something done. <br> Going to the gym can also help those to become less anxious, more confident
        and boost one's self-esteem which in return helps these individuals to use these practices in their everyday lives to get ahead of their peers.<br> Consequently, these practices not only propelled my confidence 
        but my ability to achieve whatever I want to achieve in life, which in return has helped me to become who I am today.</p>
        <h2>Week 2 : CROWDSOURCING</h2>
        <p> The project called Dead Drops, is an anonymous, offline, peer-to-peer file sharing network in public spaces. Basically, there are USB flash drives stuck into walls, buildings,
            and curbs for anyone to access. Users are encouraged to drop their files into the flash drives (dead drops) and can connect their laptops to share or receive data, which is stored on a 
            read.me file. So essently, this project is a way for people in the area of the dead drop to anonymously share their data with others and receive data from others. The article written by
            McCarthy is a project or experiment where the participant is taking information from an outside source, and they must do what they are told to do guide conversations with
            strangers. Participants are on a date, their actions and decisisions are essentially guided by narrators. To answer this weeks question on how the project; Dead Drops
            relates to the main topic covered in the experiment done by McCarthy. Dead Drops relates to the article written by McCarthy in ways that informtation is shared via peer to peer
            communication. Information sent from one user is received to another user through a peer to peer network. For example, in the dating simulator, the participant is receiving directions
            from an individual on how they should react or act during the date. This individual is receiving information and outputing what they received. In the same regard, Dead Drops, people from all
            over the world can share information to those who choose to receive the information and vice versa. In Dead Drops, since the flash drives are in walls, buildings and curbs, it means that anyone can access
            these drives, thus meaning information is to be received and transfered. Consequently, in correlation to the dating experiment, information is received then transfered to the other individual either
            through conversations or actions, and anyone in the world can participate.
